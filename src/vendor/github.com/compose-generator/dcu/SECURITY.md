# Security Policy
We attach great importance to the security of our users data, but we are humans and not infallible.
That's why we rely on you, the open source contributors, to inform us about actual and possible security vulnerabilities.
Please follow the guideline below to get in touch with us, even if you're not sure, if your issue is regarding the data security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities, as GitHub issues are publicly accessible!!!**

Instead, contact us per mail ([contact@chillibits.com](mailto:contact@chillibits.com)). We guarantee a response within two workdays and a security patch as fast as possible.

Thanks for your cooperation and your understanding.
