:new: - New templates, which were released with the latest version of Compose Generator <br>
:fontawesome-brands-dev: - New templates, which are currently in preview and will be released with the next version of Compose Generator

If you miss a predefined template and you want to create one for the public, please first read our [contribution guidelines](../contributing) and then continue reading the instructions on how to [contribute a service template](https://github.com/compose-generator/compose-generator/blob/docs/supported-services-page/predefined-services/README.md). Fork the repository, create the template and open a pr to the `dev` branch. The community is thankful for every predefined template!
