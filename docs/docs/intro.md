# Introduction
Compose Generator is a command line tool, which helps you to setup your Docker projects as fast as possible. The cli acts like a helper to handle common Docker tasks, like managing Docker Compose configurations with a simple interface.

The focus of Compose Generator is to increase productivity and efficiency of common use cases like setting up Docker and Docker Compose and deploying a software stack. It makes use of predefined service templates, that you can use to get exacly what you need and want. Nothing more, nothing less. Compose Generator is also made to be extensible, so if you miss any predefined service, head on to the [contribution guide](https://github.com/compose-generator/compose-generator/tree/main/predefined-services) and provide one!
