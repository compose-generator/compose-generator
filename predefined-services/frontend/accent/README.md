## Accent
Accent is an open-source translation management tool for developers. It supports many translation formats, allows collaboration and offers a cli and a GraphQL API.

### Setup
Accent is considered as frontend service and can therefore be found in frontends collection, when generating the compose configuration with Compose Generator.

**CAUTION: Do not use the default setup in production. The default configuration exposes a dummy login with an email address only. Please see [the authentication setup guide](https://github.com/mirego/accent#authentication-setup) for more information.**

If you want to send emails from your Accent instance, please take a look at [this guide](https://github.com/mirego/accent#email-setup).
