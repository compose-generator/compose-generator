## PostgreSQL Database
PostgreSQL or for short 'Postgres' is a relational database management system.

### Setup
Compose Generator will ask you for the name of a dedicated database and the name of a dedicated user for your application. This database and user will be created on the first startup of the database container. Furthermore the cli automatically generates database user password for you, so you don't need to specify them yourself.
