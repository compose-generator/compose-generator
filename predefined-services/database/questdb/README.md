## QuestDB
QuestDB is a open source database management system with focus on realtime time series data. It supports SQL and can be connected to PostgreSQL / InfluxDB databases via protocol interfaces.

## Setup
QuestDB exposes a REST API endpoint, which also includes an administration user interface. Optionally, you can enable the port exposure of the Postgres Wire interface and/or the InfluxDB Line interface.

*Warning: QuestDB is not password-protected by default*
