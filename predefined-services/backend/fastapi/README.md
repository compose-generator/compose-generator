## FastAPI
FastAPI is a high-performance, easy to learn, fast to code and ready for production framework for building APIs. It is based on Python 3.6+ and can handle massive amounts of requests in parallel due to its asynchronous programming style.

### Setup
FastAPI is considered as backend service and can therefore be found in backends collection, when generating the compose configuration with Compose Generator.
