## Django
Django is a web application framework that uses Python as its base language. It has support for the MVC design pattern and is especially powerful in combination for building database reliant applications. It offers a auto-generated, production ready administration UI and has a lot of indispensable features for web development.

### Setup
Django is considered as backend service and can therefore be found in backends collection, when generating the compose configuration with Compose Generator.

### Usage
If you let Compose Generator generate your configuration, it will create a demo application for you. You can start this demo application out of the box and modify or rewrite it from scratch if you choose to.
