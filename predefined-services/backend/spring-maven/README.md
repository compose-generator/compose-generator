## Spring Maven backend
The Spring framework is a commonly used framework for building microservices and/or web APIs. It can be used in combination with one of Java, Kotlin or Groovy as its base language. Spring is also flexible with its underlying build system, thus it can be used in combination with Maven or Gradle. However, this predefined service is for Maven as build system. If you want to build your Spring app with Gradle, please refer to the predefined service `Spring Gradle`.

### Setup
Depending on the language that you chose (Java/Kotlin/Groovy), Compose Generator will create a demo project in this language. This demo app can be started out of the box, but does not contain any REST controllers. So you might see the default error page.
