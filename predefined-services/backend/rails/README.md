## Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that uses Ruby as its base language. It has support for the MVC design pattern and is especially powerful in combination for building database reliant applications.

### Setup
Rails is considered as backend service and can therefore be found in backends collection, when generating the compose configuration with Compose Generator.

### Usage
If you let Compose Generator generate your configuration, it will create a demo application for you. You can start this demo application out of the box and modify or rewrite it from scratch if you choose to.
